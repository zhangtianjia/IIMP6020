# Estimation Tutorial

## Problem Definition
One of the most important procedure of controlling drones to follow the pre-defined path is to obtain the pose (includes position and orientation) in the environment map. The procedure requires high-precision sensors and high-acuuracy algorithms. Here we use cameras with markers and correspondent computer vision algorhtims to estimate the pose.
